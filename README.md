# Hello there! 👋

My name is **Jay**, I’m an aspiring Full-Stack Developer and a recent BS in Information Technology graduate from Rizal Technological University (RTU) with a strong interest in software development and quality assurance, as a former Software QA Engineer Intern, I gained hands-on experience in testing processes and learned how to collaborate effectively with agile/scrum cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, and project managers. I’m familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, and MySQL, and I’m continuously learning to expand my skills through personal projects.

- :hammer: I’m currently working on [PCCLMS](https://github.com/Frijaaay/pcclms) and API first Backend [PCCLMS-API](https://github.com/Frijaaay/pcclms-api)

- :seedling: I’m currently learning **Vue.js, Laravel, Azure**
